# odin-recipes

BEFORE PROJECT STARTS:
This project is mainly to focus on the basics of the use of coding html and as well as working along side github, making commits, allowing muscle memory to set in for future projects, and lastly to be able to build a basic project on github with vscode and whatnot.

SELF REFLECTION:

PERSONAL:
(7/20/2024) - This may be an Odin Project, but I may use this to actually put recipes that I find and will use again when I come here. It is very inspiring in order to make other certain pages that I can show and share with other people.
