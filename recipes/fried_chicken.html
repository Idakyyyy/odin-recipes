        <h3>Coating Stage:</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>any pieces of chicken</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <!--Steps and Directions-->
        <h2>Following the Steps</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Spice Prep</h3>
        <p>Mix the Paprika, Black Pepper, Garlic Powder, Dried Oregano, and Cayenna Pepper together in a bowl for an overall mix.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Brining</h3>
        <p> Mix together the egg, buttermilk, 1 tsp of salt, and 2 tsp of the overall spice mix into a bowl large enough to add your chicken pieces together. 
            Toss the chicken in the bowl and make sure that each part of the chicken you added are covered with the brine. After that, transfer the chicken in 
            the brine into either a zipblock bag or airtight bowl, refridgerating for at least 1 hr to a max of 6 hrs. Make sure to check occasionally that the 
            chicken is coated evenly

        <h3>Step 3: Coating</h3>
        <p>
            Mix together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 tsp of salt, and put the rest of the spice mix into a bowl. The catalyst for keeping the coating 
            on the chicken is to add 3 tsp of the brine/marinade from the ziplock/bowl and add it to the bowl with your hands rather than pouring it in. Take a 
            piece of chicken at a time and let the marinade drip off before putting it in the flour mixture, tossing and coating it on the chicken. Repeat this process 
            until all chicken are in the bowl at the same time. Keep mixing and coating the chicken until each chicken are thoroughly coated. In further be thorough with this process,
            use your hands to coat a thicker layer on the chicken. Put the chicken on a fine-mesh strainer, if possible, in order to remove excess flour. Move to a wire rack with a baking sheet
            for any excess flour and for later after frying.

        <h3>Step 4: Frying</h3>
        <p>Have a cast iron or wok with oil and heat it up to about 350Â°F or when it feels hot enough, do not make the heat too high as to make sure the inside of the chcken cooks well. 
            When frying, there is no need to have the heat too high as the coating may get too darkened unless that is what you are going for. When the chicken goes into the oil, 
            the temperature will drop so don't put too many pieces all at once. Fry the chicken until it is golden brown and should take about 8 or more minnutes depending on how the heat 
            of your oil is at. Don't move the chicken too much, but if the oil isn't high enough to cover your chicken then you will need to flip it over and cook it on both sides evenly.
            After both sides are cooked, place it back onto the wire rack to let the oil drip onto the baking sheet and let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes.
